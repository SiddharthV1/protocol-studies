# Overview

Beyond its fundamental role of transaction execution, the execution layer client undertakes several critical responsibilities. These include verification of the blockchain data and storing its local copy, facilitating network communication through gossip protocols with other execution layer clients, maintaining a transaction pool, and fulfilling the Consensus layer's requirements that drive its functionality. This multifaceted operation ensures the robustness and integrity of the Ethereum network

The client's architecture is grounded in a series of detailed specifications, each playing a unique role in its comprehensive functionality. This document aims to provide a concise overview of the core specification. For a deeper understanding of how all the specifications seamlessly work together within the execution layer Client.

## Engine

The execution layer client acts as an _execution engine_ and exposes the Engine API, an authenticated endpoint which connects to the consensus layer client. The engine is also referred to as the external consensus engine by the execution layer clients. The execution layer client can be only driven by a single consensus layer but a consensus layer client implementations can connect to multiple execution layer clients for redundancy. The Engine API uses the JSON-RPC interface over HTTP and requires authentication via a [JWT](https://jwt.io/introduction) token. Additionally the Engine JSON-RPC is not exposed to anyone besides the consensus layer. However, its important to note that the JWT is primarily used for authenticating the Payload, i.e. the sender is the consensus layer client, it does not encrypt the traffic.

### Internal Consensus Engines 

The execution layer has its own consensus engine to work with its own copy of the beacon chain. The execution layer consensus engine is known as ethOne and has about half the functionality of the full fledged consensus engine of the consensus layer.
The algorithm agnostic interface of the consensus engine in execution layer has these functions

## Transaction pools

we have primarily two kinds of txPools :

1. legacy pools- this in geth contains price-sorted heaps / priority-queues
   where the transactions are sorted by price
   Two heaps are used for sorting: one is based on the effective tip in the next block) and the other based on gasFeeCap. On saturation the bigger of the two is chosen for eviction
2. blob pools - this also keeps a priority heap for eviction but there are a few things different about this, the code has an excelent comments section for these [blobPools](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/064f37d6f67a012eea0bf8d410346fb1684004b4/core/txpool/blobpool/blobpool.go#L132) also note that logarithms are used in eviction queues in blob pools

In Ethereum two primary types of transaction pools (txPools) are recognized:

1. **Legacy Pools**: Managed by Geth, these pools employ price-sorted heaps or priority queues to organize transactions based on their price. Specifically, transactions are arranged using two heaps: one prioritizes the effective tip for the upcoming block, and the other focuses on the gas fee cap. During periods of saturation, the larger of these two heaps is selected for the eviction of transactions, optimizing the pool's efficiency and responsiveness. [urgent and floating heaps](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/064f37d6f67a012eea0bf8d410346fb1684004b4/core/txpool/legacypool/list.go#L525)

2. **Blob Pools**: Unlike legacy pools, blob pools maintain a priority heap for transaction eviction but incorporate distinct mechanisms for operation. Notably, the implementation of blob pools is well-documented, with an extensive comments section available for review [here](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/064f37d6f67a012eea0bf8d410346fb1684004b4/core/txpool/blobpool/blobpool.go#L132). A key feature of blob pools is the use of logarithmic functions in their eviction queues.
