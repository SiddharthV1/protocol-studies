# Client Architecture

## Overview

Beyond execution layer's fundamental role of transaction execution, the execution layer client undertakes several critical responsibilities. These include verification of the blockchain data and storing its local copy, facilitating network communication through gossip protocols with other execution layer clients, maintaining a transaction pool, and fulfilling the consensus layer's requirements that drive its functionality. This multifaceted operation ensures the robustness and integrity of the Ethereum network.

The client's architecture is built around a variety of specific standards, each of which plays a unique role in the overall functionality. The execution engine is located at the top, driving the execution layer, which in turn is driven by the consensus layer. The execution layer runs on top of DevP2P, the networking layer, which is initialized by providing legitimate boot nodes that provide an initial access point into the network. When we call one of the engine API methods, such as fork choice updated, we can download blocks from peers by subscribing to topics like our preferred mode of sync.

The diagram illustrates a simplified representation of the design, excluding several components.

**EVM**

Ethereum is centered around a virtualized central processing unit (CPU). Computers have their own central processing units (CPUs) at a hardware level, which can be of many types such as x86, ARM, RISC-V, or others. These varied processor architectures have unique instruction sets that enable them to perform tasks such as arithmetic, logic, and data manipulation, allowing the computer to function as a general-purpose computing machine. Therefore, when executing a program written in the hardware-level instruction set, the outcome may vary depending on the specific hardware on which it is executed. Thus In computer science, we address this problem by virtualizing instruction sets through the creation of virtual machines, such as the JVM (Java Virtual Machine). These virtual machines ensure consistent results regardless of the underlying hardware. The EVM is a virtualized execution engine designed for ethereum programs. It ensures consistent results regardless of the hardware it runs on and facilitates consensus among all Ethereum clients regarding computation outcomes.

In addition, Ethereum incorporates a sandwich complexity model as part of its design philosophy. This implies that the outer layers should be uncomplicated, while all the intricacy should be concentrated in the middle layers. In this context, the EVM's code can be seen as the outermost layer, while a high-level language like Solidity may be considered as the top layer. In between, there is a complicated compiler that translates the solidity code into the EVM's bytecode.

**State**

Ethereum is a general purpose computational system that operates as a state machine, meaning it may transition between several states depending on the inputs it receives. In addition, Ethereum differs significantly from other blockchains like Bitcoin in that it maintains a global state, whereas Bitcoin only keeps global unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs). The term "state" refers to the comprehensive collection of data, data structures (such as Merkle-Patricia Tries), and databases that store various information. This includes addresses, balances, code and data for contracts, as well as the current state and network state.

**Transactions**

The EVM produces data and modifies the state of the Ethereum network through a process called state transition. This state transition is triggered by transactions, which are processed within the EVM. If a transaction is deemed legitimate, it results in a state change of the Ethereum network.

**DevP2P**

The interface for communicating with otherÂ  the execution layer clients. Transactions initially stored in the mempool, which serves as a repository for all incoming transactions, are disseminated by execution layer clients to other execution layer clients in the network using peer-to-peer communication. Every recipient of the transaction sent over the network confirms its validity before broadcasting it to the network.

**JSON-RPC API**

When utilizing a wallet or a DApp, our communication with the execution layer is conducted over a standardized JSON-RPC API. This enables us to externally query the Ethereum state or dispatch a transaction to it, signed by the wallet, which is subsequently validated by the execution layer client and disseminated around the network.

**Engine API**

This is the only link between the consensus and execution layer. The engine exposes two major classes of endpoints to the consensus layer: **fork choice updated** and **new payload** suffixed by the three versions they are exposed as (V1-V3).These methods encapsulate two major pipelines offered by the execution layer:

1.  **New Payload\***(V1/V2/V3)\*: payload validation & insertion pipeline.
2.  **Fork Choice Updated\***(V1/V2/V3)\*: state synchronization & block building pipeline.

**Sync**

In order to accurately process transactions on Ethereum, it is imperative that we reach a consensus on the global status of the network, rather than solely relying on our local perspective. The global state synchronization of the execution layer client is triggered by the fork choice rule governed by the LMD-GHOST algorithm in the consensus layer. It is then relayed to the execution layer through the fork choice updated endpoint of the engine API. Syncing entails two possible processes: downloading remote blocks from peers and validating them in the EVM.

Note: client specific overviews will go here

### Reth

The image represents a rough component flow of reth's architecture:

<img src="images/el-architecture/reth-architecture-overview.png" width="1000"/>

- **Engine**: Similar to other clients, it is the primary driver of reth.
- **Sync**: Reth has two modes of sync historical and live
- **Pipeline**: The pipeline performs historical sync in a sequential manner, enabling us to optimize each stage of the synchronization process. The pipeline is split into stages , where a [stage](https://paradigmxyz.github.io/reth/docs/reth_stages/trait.Stage.html) is a trait that provides us with a function to execute the stage or unwind(undo) it. Currently the pipeline has 12 stages that can be configured, with the first two running separately, the pipeline proceeds top to bottom except when there is a problem encountered then it proceeds to unwind from the issue stage upwards :
  1. **HeaderStage**: Header verification stage.
  2. **BodyStage**: Download blocks over P2P.
  3. **SenderRecoveryStage**: The computation is costly as it retrieves the sender's address from the signature for each transaction in the block's body.
  4. **ExecutionStage**: The most time-consuming & computationally heavy stage involves taking the sender, transaction, and header and executing them within the REVM. This process generates receipts and change sets. Change sets are data structures that function as hash maps and depict the modifications that occur between accounts inside a single block. In addition, the execution stage operates on a plain state that contains only the addresses and account information in the form of key-value pairs.
  5. **MerkleStage**(unwind): Skipped during the execution flow, used when unwinding.
  6. **AccountHashingStage**: Required by the merkle stage,we take the plain state and apply a hashing function to it. Then, we save the resulting hashed account in a database specifically designed for storing accounts.
  7. **StorageHashingStage**: Similar to above but for storage.
  8. **MerkleStage**(execute): generates a state root by using the hashes produced by the two preceding stages and then checks if the resulting state root is accurate for the given block.
  9. **TransactionLookupStage**: Helper stage, allows us to do transaction lookup.
  10. **IndexStorageHistoryStage**: Enables us to retrieve past data, the execution phase generates the change set, which then indexes the data that existed prior to the execution of the block. Enables us to retrieve the historical data for any given block number.
  11. **IndexAccountHistoryStage**: Similar to above.
  12. **FinishStage**:We notify that the engine is now capable of receiving new fork choice updates from the consensus layer's.
- **BlockchainTree**: When we are nearing the end of the chain during the syncing process, we transition to the blockchain tree. The synchronization occurs close to the tip, when state root validation and execution take place in memory.
- **Database**: When a block gets canonicalized, it is moved to the database
- **Provider**: An abstraction over database that provides utility functions to help us avoid directly accessing the keys and values of the underlying database.
- **Downloader**: Retrieves blocks and headers using peer-to-peer(P2P) networks. This tool is utilized by the pipeline during its initial two stages and by the engine in the event that it need to bridge the gap at the tip.
- **P2P**: When we approach the tip, we transfer the transactions we have read over P2P to the transaction pool.
- **Transaction Pool**: Includes DDoS mitigation measures. Consists of transactions arranged in ascending order based on the gas price preferred by the users.
- **Payload Builder**: Extracts the initial n transactions in order to construct a fresh payload.
- **Pruner**: Allows us to have a full node.Once the block has been canonicalized by the blockchain tree, we must wait for an additional 64 blocks for it to reach finalization. Once the finalization process is complete, we can be certain that the block will not undergo reorganization. Therefore, if we are operating a full node, we have the option to eliminate the old block using the pruner.

## Components of the architecture

### Engine

The execution layer client acts as an _execution engine_ and exposes the Engine API, an authenticated endpoint, which connects to the consensus layer client. The engine is also referred to as the external consensus engine by the execution layer clients. The execution layer client can be only be driven by a single consensus layer, but a consensus layer client implementations can connect to multiple execution layer clients for redundancy. The Engine API uses the JSON-RPC interface over HTTP and requires authentication via a [JWT](https://jwt.io/introduction) token. Additionally the Engine JSON-RPC is not exposed to anyone besides the consensus layer. However, it's important to note that the JWT is primarily used for authenticating the Payload, i.e. sender is the consensus layer client, it does not encrypt the traffic.

#### Routines

##### Payload validation

Payload is validated with respect to the block header and execution environment rule sets:

<img src="images/el-architecture/payload-validation-routine.png" width="1000"/>

With the merge, the function of the execution layer has been altered within the Ethereum network. Previously, it was tasked with the responsibility of managing the consensus of the blockchain, ensuring the correct order of blocks, as well as handling reorganizations. However, after the merge, these tasks have been delegated to the consensus layer, resulting in a significant simplification of the execution layer. Now, we can conceptualize the execution layer as primarily carrying out the state transition function.

In order to gain a better understanding of the aforementioned concept, it is beneficial to examine the perspective of the consensus layer in relation to the execution layer. The consensus specification defines the _process execution payload_ in the deneb beacon chain specs, which is carried out by the beacon chain while undergoing several verifications required to validate a block and advance the consensus layer. The execution layer here is represented by the `execution_engine` function, which serves as a means of communication between the consensus layer and the execution layer and has a lot of varied complexities to it.

During _process execution payload_ , we begin by conducting several high-level checks, including verifying the accuracy of the parent hash and validating the timestamp. Additionally, we perform various lightweight verifications. Subsequently, we transmit the payload to the execution layer, where it undergoes block verification. The notify payload function, is the lowest level function that serves as the interface between the consensus layer and the execution engine. It contains only the function's signature, without any implementation details. Its sole purpose is to transmit the execution payload to the execution engine, which acts as the client for the execution layer. The execution engine then carries out the actual state transition function, which involves verifying the accuracy of block headers and ensuring that transactions are correctly applied to the state. The execution engine will ultimately return a boolean value indicating whether the state transition was successful or not. From the standpoint of the consensus layer, this is simply the validation of blocks.

This is a simplified description of the block level state transition function (stf) in go. The stf is a crucial component of the block validation and insertion pipeline. Although the example is specific to geth, it represents the functioning of the stf in other clients as well. It is worth mentioning that the state transition function is rarely referred to by its name in the code of different clients, save for the EELS python spec client. This is because its real operations are divided across many components of the client's architecture.

```go
func stf(parent types.Block, block types.Block, state state.StateDB) (state.StateDB, error) { //1
    if err := core.VerifyHeaders(parent, block); err != nil { //2
            // header error detected
            return nil, err
  }
  for _, tx := range block.Transactions() { //3
      res, err := vm.Run(block.header(), tx, state)
      if err != nil {
              // transaction invalid, block is invalid
              return nil, err
      }
      state = res
  }
  return state, nil
}
```

1. State transition function's parameters and return values
   - In this context, we examine both the parent block and the current block in order to validate certain transition logic from the parent block to the current block.
   - We take the state DB in as an argument, which contains all the state data related to the parent block. This represents the most recent valid state.
   - We return the state DB representing the updated state after the state transition
   - if the state transition fails we don't update the state DB and return the error
2. In the state transition functions procedure we first verify the headers
   - As an illustration of the failure of header verification, let us consider the gas limit field, which is also of historical significance. Currently, the gas limit stands at around 30 million. It's important to note that the gas limit is not fixed within the execution layer. Block producers have the capacity to modify the gas limit using a technique that allows them to increase or decrease it by 1/1024th of the gas limit of the preceding block. Therefore, if you raise the gas limit from 30 million to 40 million within a single block, the header verification will fail because it exceeds the threshold of 30 million plus one-thousandth of 30 million.
   - Additional instances of header verification failure can arise when the block numbers are not in sequential order. Typically, the beacon chain is responsible for detecting such discrepancies, although there are instances where it is detected at this stage as well. Failures may also arise when the 1559 base fee is not accurately updated according to the comparison between the last gas used and the gas limit.
3. Once the header verification is completed, we consider the environment in the header as the environment in which the transactions should be executed and we apply the transactions. We iterate over the transactions in the block and execute each transaction in the evm.
   - The block headers are passed to the EVM in order to provide the necessary context for processing the transaction. This context includes instructions such as coinbase, gas limit, and timestamp, which are required for proper execution.
   - Additionally we pass in the transaction and the state
   - In the event of a failed execution, we simply return the error, indicating an invalid transaction within the block and thereby rendering the block invalid. Within the execution layer, the presence of anything erroneous in a block renders the entire block invalid, as it contaminates the block as a whole.
   - Once we confirm the validity of the transactions, we proceed to update our state with the result . The state now represent the accumulated state that has all the transaction in the new block applied to it.

From the standpoint of beacon chains, the state transition function mentioned above is encompassed by the invocation of the "new payload" function.

```go
func newPayload(execPayload engine.ExecutionPayload) bool {
    if _, err := stf(..); err != nil {
        return false
  }
  return true
}
```

The beacon chainÂ  invokes the new payload function and transfers the execution payload as an argument. On the execution layer, we invoke the state transition function using the information from the execution payload. If the state transition function does not produce an error, we return true. Otherwise, we return false to indicate that the block is invalid.

##### Payload building

Note: The fee recipient of the built payload may deviate from the suggested fee recipient of the payload attributes:

<img src="images/el-architecture/payload-building-routine.png" width="1000"/>

Nodes are gossiping transactions via a peer-to-peer network. These transactions are deemed valid and not included in the block. Validity here, among other things, refers to the condition where the nonce of the transaction is the next valid nonce for the account and the account holds sufficient value to cover the transaction. Occasionally, the node is assigned the responsibility of generating a block, the consensus layer employs a random selection process to determine which validator will construct the block during each epoch. If your validator is chosen to build the block, your consensus layer client will proceed with constructing it using the execution engine's fork choice updated method, providing the necessary context for block construction.

We can simplify and emulate the process of constructing blocks, albeit this is specific to the goÂ  with types used in geth. However, the approach is general enough to be adaptable to different clients.

```go
func build(env environment, pool txpool.Pool, state state.StateDB) (types.Block, state.StateDB, error) { //1
    var (
        gasUsed = 0
        txs []types.Transactions
    ) //2

  for ; gasUsed < 30_000_000 || !pool.Empty(); { //3
      transaction := pool.Pop() //4
      res, gas, err := vm.Run(env, transaction, state) //5
      if err != nil { // 6
          // transaction invalid
          continue
      }
      gasUsed += gas // 7
      transactions = append(transactions, transaction)
  }
  return core.Finalize(env, transactions, state) //8
}
```

1. We take in the environment, which contains all the necessary information (similar to the header previously), including the time stamp, block number, preceding block, base fee, and all the withdrawals that need to occur in the block. Essentially, the information originating from the consensus layer, which acts as the central decision-making entity, determines the context in which the block should be constructed. Next, we take in the transaction pool, which is a collection of transactions. For simplicity, we assume that these transactions are arranged in ascending order based on their value. This arrangement helps us construct the most profitable block for the execution client, considering the transactions observed in the network. Additionally, we also consider a state DB, representing the state over which all these transactions are executed.
   - We return a block, a state DB that has accumulated all the transactions in the block and possibly an error
2. Inside build we track the gas used because there is only a finite amount of gas we can use. And, also store all the transactions that are going to go in the block
3. We continue adding the transactions until the pool is empty or the amount of gas consumed is greater than the gas limit, which is fixed at 30 million (about the current gas limit on the mainnet) in this example for the sake of simplicity.
4. In order to obtain a transaction, we must query the transaction pool, which is presumed to maintain an ordered list of transactions, ensuring that we always receive the next most valuable transaction.
5. The transaction is executed in the EVM, assuming that run requires an interface that is satisfied by both the block and the environment. We provide the environment, transaction, and state as input. ThisÂ  will execute the transaction within the context defined by the environment and provide us with an updated state that will include the accumulated transaction.
6. If the transaction execution is unsuccessful, indicated by the occurrence of an error during the run, we simply proceed without interruption. This indicates that the transaction is invalid and since there is still unused gas leftt in the block, we do not want to generate an error immediately. This is because no error has occurred within the block yet. However, it is highly likely that the transaction is invalid because it did something bad during execution or because the transaction pool is slightly outdated. In which case we allow ourselves to continue and try to get the next transaction from the pool into this block.
7. Once we verify there is no error with running the transaction we add the transaction to the transactions list and we add the gas that was returned by run to the gas used. For example if the first transaction was a simple transfer, which costs 21,000 gas our gas used would go from 0 to 21,000 nd we would keep doing this process steps 3-7 until the conditions of step 3 are met.
8. We finalize our transition by taking set of transactions and relevant block information to generate a fully assembled block. The purpose of doing this is to perform certain calculations at the end. Since the header contains the transactions root, receipts root, and withdrawals root, these values must be computed by merkelizing a list and added to the block's header.
   - We return our block, state DB and our error

This parameter provides the required information for the execution layer to initiate a state sync

- **Payload Attributes** :

Note: Will only be sent set from the consensus layer for the block building pipeline else this parameter will be set to null , which indicates only state syn needs to be initiated during the method's call

- Procedure:
  1.  The execution layer client **may** initiate a sync if the **head block hash** refers to a block that the execution layer client has not seen or if the ancestors required for validation of the block are missing. Thus sync is specified as the process of obtaining data required to validate a payload, with these two optional stages :
      1. Fetching data from remote peers
      2. Passing ancestors of a payload through the payload validation routine, which consists of validating a payload with respect to the rule sets for block header and execution environment :
         1. The client **may** obtain a parent state by executing the ancestors of a payload, i.e. each ancestor must pass the payload validation process
         2.

### Transaction Pools

In Ethereum two primary types of transaction pools are recognized:

1. **Legacy Pools**: Managed by geth, these pools employ price-sorted heaps or priority queues to organize transactions based on their price. Specifically, transactions are arranged using two heaps: one prioritizes the effective tip for the upcoming block, and the other focuses on the gas fee cap. During periods of saturation, the larger of these two heaps is selected for the eviction of transactions, optimizing the pool's efficiency and responsiveness. [urgent and floating heaps](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/064f37d6f67a012eea0bf8d410346fb1684004b4/core/txpool/legacypool/list.go#L525)

2. **Blob Pools**: Unlike legacy pools, blob pools maintain a priority heap for transaction eviction but incorporate distinct mechanisms for operation. Notably, the implementation of blob pools is well-documented, with an extensive comments section available for review [here](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/064f37d6f67a012eea0bf8d410346fb1684004b4/core/txpool/blobpool/blobpool.go#L132). A key feature of blob pools is the use of logarithmic functions in their eviction queues.
